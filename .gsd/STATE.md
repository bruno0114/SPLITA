## Current Position
- **Phase:** Mapping
- **Status:** Active (resumed 2026-01-19T21:03)
- **Last Updated:** 2026-01-19

## Last Session Summary
**Codebase Mapping Complete.**
- 5 feature modules identified and documented in ARCHITECTURE.md
- Dependencies and infrastructure inventory updated in STACK.md
- Technical debt updated: **Transaction CRUD** and **Avatar Upload** are now implemented.
- Verified hooks and UI logic for Personal and Group transactions.

## Next Steps

1. `/plan` — create execution plans for remaining technical debt or new features.
2. `/verify` — empirically validate the new CRUD operations and avatar upload.
3. Test group invitations logic (high priority technical debt).
