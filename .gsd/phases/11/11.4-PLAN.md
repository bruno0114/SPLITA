# Plan 11.4: Category Management Dashboard

## Objective
Provide a dedicated interface for users to manage their categories: renaming, changing colors, and deleting unwanted ones.

## Context
- .gsd/ROADMAP.md

  <name>Implement Category CRUD UI</name>
  <files>
    - src/features/analytics/components/CategoryManagerModal.tsx
    - src/features/analytics/pages/Categories.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
    - **Modal**: Create a modal to edit category properties (Name, Icon, Color).
    - **Color Picker**: Use a predefined grid of Tailwind color swatches.
    - **Categories Page**: Add a "Manage" button in the `Categories.tsx` header that opens this modal/view.
    - **Delete**: Support deleting user-created categories (with a confirmation if transactions are linked).
  </action>
  <verify>Create, edit, and delete a category and observe changes in the main grid.</verify>
  <done>User has full control over their expense categories and their visual representation.</done>
</task>

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Users can edit category names and colors.
