# Plan 12.3: Subscription Tiers & Premium UI

## Objective
Implement the visual infrastructure for the Premium subscription tier, including benefit cards and the subscription modal, and audit the application for premium-targeted UI elements.

## Context
- .gsd/SPEC.md
- src/features/dashboard/pages/EconomicHealth.tsx
- src/features/dashboard/pages/PersonalFinance.tsx

## Tasks

<task type="auto">
  <name>UI Component: SubscriptionModal</name>
  <files>
    src/features/dashboard/components/SubscriptionModal.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
    Create a premium-looking modal that explains the benefits of "SPLITA Pro":
    - Unlimited AI scans (vs 3 free/day).
    - Advanced financial projections.
    - Expert AI financial coaching.
    - Multi-currency deep analysis.
    The modal should have a "Upgrade Now" button (just visual for now, showing a toast "Coming Soon").
    Use Lucide icons and Framer Motion for a premium feel.
  </action>

    Code review: verify component structure and styles.
  </verify>
  <done>
    Subscription modal created.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Integration: Premium CTAs</name>
  <files>
    src/features/dashboard/pages/EconomicHealth.tsx
    src/features/dashboard/pages/PersonalFinance.tsx
    src/features/dashboard/components/ProjectionCard.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
    Integrate the 'SubscriptionModal' into all premium calls-to-action:
    1. The "Plan Premium" card in Economic Health.
    2. Add a small "Pro" badge to advanced features like the Expenditure evolution chart or Projection card.
    3. Ensure clicking these "Saber más" or "Pro" elements opens the new modal.
  </action>
  <verify>
    Browser verification: click on premium CTAs and confirm modal opens.
  </verify>
  <done>
    Premium integration complete.
  </done>
</task>

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Users can see what they get with a Premium subscription.
- [ ] Visual consistency for "Pro" features across the app.
