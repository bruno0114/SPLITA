# Phase 18.3: FIX-JOIN-PUBLIC-LAYOUT

## Summary
Fixed the Join Group page (`/unirse/:inviteCode`) to render in the public layout (without Sidebar/Header/BottomNav) instead of the authenticated app chrome.

## Problem
Users visiting invite links while logged out saw the full authenticated UI (sidebar, header, bottom nav), causing:
1. Confusing UX showing internal nav to unauthenticated users
2. Flickering during auth transitions as the private layout mounted/unmounted

## Solution
Modified `App.tsx` routing logic:
1. Renamed `isAuthRoute` → `isPublicRoute`
2. Extended public route detection to include `/unirse/` and `/join/` paths
3. Moved join routes to public layout section
4. Removed duplicate routes from private layout

## Files Changed
- `src/App.tsx` — Routing/layout separation

## Verification
- [ ] Logged out: `/unirse/:code` shows clean UI (no sidebar/header/nav)
- [ ] Login → redirect back to invite works without layout flash
- [ ] `/join/:code` redirects to `/unirse/:code`
- [ ] Protected routes unchanged (dashboard still has full chrome)

## Status: COMPLETE ✓
