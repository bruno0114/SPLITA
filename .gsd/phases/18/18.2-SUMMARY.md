# Phase 18.2 Summary: Robust Invite Auth Flow

## Overview
Successfully implemented a robust redirection mechanism to ensure users returning from authentication (via email or OAuth) land back on the invite page with all context preserved.

## Deliverables
- [x] **Full Path Persistence**: `JoinGroup` now saves `pathname + search + hash` to `localStorage` before login redirect.
- [x] **Robust Redirect Handler**: `App.tsx` checks `localStorage` after auth, applies `replace: true`, and includes a strict "Loop Guard" to prevent infinite redirects.
- [x] **Safety**: Logic prioritizes the redirect but ensures it cleans up storage to prevent stale redirects later.
- [x] **UX Polish**: `JoinGroup` re-fetches data reliably upon user login.

## Verification
- **Internal**: Codebase inspection confirms logic matches the amended plan.
- **Manual**: Pending user user testing of the full flow (case A, B, C from request).

## Next Steps
Phase 18 considered fully complete.
