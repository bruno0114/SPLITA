# Plan 15.3: Groups Mobile Redesign (Card View)

## Objective
Redesign the Groups screen for mobile by converting the current layout into a vertical card stack with improved readability and touch-friendly interactions.

## Context
- `src/features/groups/pages/Groups.tsx`: Main groups list.
- `src/features/groups/pages/GroupDetails.tsx`: Group detail view with transactions.

## Tasks

    1. Review the current GroupCard component structure.
    2. Ensure cards stack vertically with proper spacing (gap-4 or gap-6).
    3. On mobile, ensure all information is clearly visible without horizontal scroll.
    4. Adjust font sizes and padding for mobile readability (reduce if needed).
    5. Ensure touch targets are at least 44px for buttons and clickable areas.
    6. Test that member avatars, balance info, and group icons are well-aligned.

    5. Add responsive padding adjustments (reduce on small screens).
    6. Verify that bulk selection checkboxes are touch-friendly.
