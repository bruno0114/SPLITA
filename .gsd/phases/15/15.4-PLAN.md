# Plan 15.4: Categories Visibility & Modal Overflow Fixes

## Objective
Make the Categories section accessible on mobile and fix modal overflow issues where the bottom navbar obscures content.

## Context
- `src/features/analytics/pages/Categories.tsx`: Categories page.
- All modal components across the app (TransactionModal, GroupSettingsModal, etc.).
- `src/components/layout/BottomNav.tsx`: Bottom navigation bar.

## Tasks

<task type="auto">
  <name>Ensure Categories Page is Accessible on Mobile</name>
  <files>
    - src/features/analytics/pages/Categories.tsx
    - src/App.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
    1. Verify that the Categories route is accessible from mobile navigation.
    2. If not visible in BottomNav, ensure it's accessible via a menu or alternative entry point.
    3. Review the Categories page layout for mobile responsiveness.
    4. Ensure category cards/lists are readable and properly spaced on small screens.
    5. Test navigation to and from the Categories page on mobile.
  </action>
  <verify>Navigate to Categories on mobile; verify page is accessible and displays correctly.</verify>
  <done>Categories page is accessible and fully functional on mobile devices.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Fix Modal Overflow and Navbar Overlap</name>
  <files>
    - src/features/groups/pages/GroupDetails.tsx (GroupTransactionModal, GroupSettingsModal)
    - src/features/expenses/components/TransactionModal.tsx
    - src/features/auth/pages/Onboarding.tsx
    - Any other modal components
  </files>
  <action>
    1. Identify all modal components that may be obscured by BottomNav.
    2. Ensure modal containers have proper z-index hierarchy:
       - Modal backdrop: z-40
       - Modal content: z-50
       - BottomNav: z-30 (or ensure modals are higher)
    3. Add `overflow-y-auto` to modal content containers.
    4. Add bottom padding (pb-24 or pb-32) to modal content to prevent navbar overlap.
    5. Ensure modals are scrollable when content exceeds viewport height.
    6. Test on mobile viewport with various modal sizes.
  </action>
  <verify>Open various modals on mobile; verify all content is accessible by scrolling and navbar doesn't hide buttons.</verify>
  <done>All modals are fully scrollable with content visible above the bottom navbar.</done>
</task>

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Categories page is accessible from mobile navigation.
- [ ] All modals have proper z-index and don't get obscured by navbar.
- [ ] Modal content is scrollable with adequate bottom padding.
- [ ] Users can access all modal buttons and inputs on mobile.
