# Plan 15.2: Dashboard UX & Filter Improvements

## Objective
Fix Dashboard interaction issues on mobile: prevent page reload on filter changes, fix calendar overlap with floating action button, and ensure smooth client-side tab switching.

## Context
- `src/features/dashboard/pages/Dashboard.tsx`: Main dashboard with filter tabs.
- `src/components/ui/PremiumDatePicker.tsx`: Calendar component that may have z-index issues.

## Tasks

<task type="auto">
  <name>Fix Filter Tabs (Client-Side Only)</name>
  <files>
    - src/features/dashboard/pages/Dashboard.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
    1. Locate the filter tabs for "Todos", "Gastos", "Ingresos" in Dashboard.tsx.
    2. Ensure these tabs use local state (useState) to filter transactions client-side.
    3. Remove any logic that causes page reload or scroll-to-top when switching filters.
    4. The filtered list should update instantly without re-fetching data or scrolling.
    5. Verify that the active tab styling updates correctly.
  </action>
  <verify>Test switching between Todos/Gastos/Ingresos on mobile; ensure no reload circle appears and scroll position is maintained.</verify>
  <done>Filter tabs work as client-side state switches without page reload or scroll jump.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Fix Calendar Overlap with Floating Action Button</name>
  <files>
    - src/components/ui/PremiumDatePicker.tsx
    - src/features/dashboard/pages/Dashboard.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
    1. Identify the calendar dropdown/modal in PremiumDatePicker.
    2. Ensure the calendar has a high z-index (e.g., z-50 or z-60) to appear above all content.
    3. Check if the "Agregar Movimiento" container or floating action button has conflicting z-index.
    4. Adjust z-index hierarchy so calendar always appears on top when open.
    5. Test on mobile viewport to ensure calendar is fully visible and clickable.
  </action>
  <verify>Open calendar on mobile; verify it appears above all other UI elements including the bottom navbar and floating buttons.</verify>
  <done>Calendar is fully visible and interactive on mobile without being obscured by other elements.</done>
</task>

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Filter tabs switch instantly without reload or scroll jump.
- [ ] Calendar appears above all UI elements when open.
- [ ] Mobile UX feels smooth and responsive for dashboard interactions.
